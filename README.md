2017/2018 Season

Growing up in Canada one could not help but to be consumed by the sport of hockey.  It touched every aspect of out community growing up in our small town, so over the many years, I gained a deep appreciation for the game.  Therefore when the opportunity presented itself to perform predictive modeling against National Hockey League (NHL) datasets, I jumped at the chance. 

The dataset can be acquired from http://www.hockeyabstract.com/testimonials/nhl2017-18, which amazingly thorough.  There are  ~200 variables and 881 objects representing every aspect of the game. 

During the exploration of the data one of the first aspects of the game that I wanted to validate.  Is the league getting younger and faster?  Are owners really interested in gambling on young players, know for timely mistakes versus proven veteran talent.

The following plot depicts Salary on the y axis and Goals across the x axis.  Scatterplot illustrates that a large amount of goals are being generhttps://github.com/smichael14/Regis-MSDS-692/blob/master/g_cnty.pngated by players on cheaper contracts, which generally correlates to young players on entry level or bridge contracts.
