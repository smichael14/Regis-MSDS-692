2017/2018 Season

Growing up in Canada one could not help but to be consumed by the sport of hockey.  It touched every aspect of out community growing up in our small town, so over the many years, I gained a deep appreciation for the game.  Therefore when the opportunity presented itself to perform predictive modeling against National Hockey League (NHL) datasets, I jumped at the chance. 

The dataset can be acquired from http://www.hockeyabstract.com/testimonials/nhl2017-18, which amazingly thorough.  There are  ~200 variables and 881 objects representing every aspect of the game.
